### How to Use:

This calculator does 1 operation at a time only.

For Arithmetic Operations:
To add 1 + 2, first click 1, then +, followed by 2 and =
This gives 1 + 2 = 3, we can then keep on adding another number onto 3, and so on.
We can't perform multiple calculations at a time eg : 1 + 2 + 3, would only calculate 2 + 3 as it can handle only 1 operation at a time.

For Trigonometric, Logarithmic and Exponential Operations:
input the number first then followed by the function.
To calculate sin(1), input will be the button 1, then sin
this returns the value of sin(1) on the above text field.

A wrong input might provide a wrong answer.
